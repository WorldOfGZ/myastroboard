# 🚀 Quick Start

This guide covers all methods to configure MyAstroBoard.

## Prerequisites

### Required
- Running installation of MyAstroBoard
- Logged in the web dashboard

> [!NOTE]
> On first connection, credential are `admin` : `admin`, you must change it.

## 📖 Configuration Guide

### 1. Configure Your Location

In the Configuration panel:
- Enter your observatory name, no real influence only displayed on certain cards
- Set latitude and longitude:
  - **Decimal format**: 48.6434 (recommended for copy-paste)
  - **DMS format**: 48d38m36.16s or 48°38'36.16" (automatically converted)
  - Converted value shown below input for verification
- Set elevation in meters
- **Select timezone** from dropdown (IANA timezone list)

### 3. Select Target Catalogues

Choose from available catalogues (automatically sorted alphabetically):
- **Messier**: Classic Messier catalogue (M1-M110) - **Selected by default**
- **Herschel400**: Herschel 400 deep-sky objects
- **OpenNGC**: Open NGC catalogue
- **LBN**: Lynds Bright Nebulae
- **LDN**: Lynds Dark Nebulae
- **GaryImm**: Gary Imm's selected targets
- And more... Maybe !

**Note**: At least one catalogue must always be selected. Catalogues are linked to the UpTonight repository.

### 4. Configure Advanced Settings (Optional)

Expand the **Advanced Settings** section for full control, based on UpTonight configuration:

**Features** (enable/disable specific outputs):
- ✅ Horizon plotting
- ✅ Object targets
- ✅ Solar system bodies
- ✅ Comets
- ✅ Altitude-time charts
All features enabled by default.

**Constraints**:
- Altitude range (min: 30°, max: 80°)
- Airmass limit (default: 2)
- Object size range (10-300 arc minutes)
- Moon separation (min: 45°)
- Observable fraction threshold (0.5)
- Maximum targets to calculate (60)

**Bucket List**:
- Add priority targets to always include (one per line)
- Example: IC 434, NGC 2359, M 16

**Done List**:
- Exclude already-observed targets (one per line)
- Example: IC 1795, LBN 535

**Custom Targets**:
- Define your own targets in YAML format
- Includes name, type, coordinates, magnitude, size

**Horizon Profile**:
- Define custom horizon with azimuth/altitude anchor points
- Useful for locations with obstructions

> [!NOTE]
> UpTonight execution is scheduled. If you made change and you want test now, you can click on "Run UpTonight Now" button on Parameters page.

## 📖 Usage Guide

### 1. Forecast

> [!NOTE]
> Forecast for weather, and astro informations can use heavy ressources. All data are cached after the first execution (1 hour for weather, 1/2h for moon & sun).

#### a. Weather

Weather tab will present some important informations for the next 12 hours. Theses information comes from Open Meteo, some of them are calculated locally (like astro score)

#### b. Best Window

Best window is an estimate to calcul the best time frame we can have during a night. This is calculated following 3 modes explained on the tab.

#### c. Observation conditions

Nice charts to have a easy knowledge of the future weather conditions

#### d. Moon & Sun

Usefull informations about Moon and Sun

### 2. UpTonight

> [!TIP]
> Catalogue Tabs are displayed after the first successfull execution.

Navigate to the **Dashboard** section to view uptonight outputs:

**Catalogue Tabs** (one per selected catalogue):
- **UpTonight outputs**: all elements comes from UpTonight execution
- **Visibility Plot**: uptonight-plot.png showing target visibility
- **Target Table**: Sortable/filterable table of targets
  - Filter by foto score (e.g., show only >= 0.8 quality targets)
  - Click target name to view altitude-time plot in popup (if alttime enabled)
  - Sort by any column (name, type, constellation, foto score, etc.)
  - Use the search box to find specific targets
  - **Add to Astrodex**: Click the "➕ Add" button to add objects to your Astrodex collection
  - **Already captured**: Objects in your Astrodex show "✓ Captured" badge
- **Bodies/Comets**: Separate tables if enabled in features

### 3. Astrodex - Gotta Catch 'Em All!

> [!NOTE]
> Astrodex is your personal collection of celestial objects you've photographed. Each user has their own separate Astrodex.

The **Astrodex** tab provides a Pokédex-style collection system for astrophotography:

#### Adding Objects to Your Astrodex

There are two ways to add objects:

1. **From Catalogues**: 
   - Browse any UpTonight catalogue (Messier, NGC, etc.)
   - Click the "➕ Add" button next to any object
   - Objects already in your Astrodex show "✓ Captured"

2. **Manually**:
   - Click "➕ Add Object" button in the Astrodex tab
   - Enter object name, type, constellation, and notes
   - Submit to add to your collection

#### Managing Your Collection

**Stats Overview**: View at a glance:
- Total objects captured
- Objects with photos vs without
- Total photos in your collection
- Number of different object types

**Filtering & Sorting**:
- **Search**: Find objects by name, type, or constellation
- **Filter by Type**: Galaxy, Nebula, Star Cluster, etc.
- **Filter by Photos**: Show only objects with/without photos
- **Sort by**: Name, Type, Date Added, or Photo Count
- **Sort Order**: Ascending or Descending

#### Adding Photos to Objects

Click on any object card to open the detail view:

1. **Add Photos**: Click "📷 Add Photo" button
2. **Upload Image**: Select an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
3. **Add Metadata**:
   - Observation date
   - Exposition time (e.g., "120x30s")
   - Device/telescope used
   - Filters (e.g., "LRGB", "Ha-OIII")
   - ISO setting
   - Number of frames
   - Additional notes
4. **Submit**: Photo is added to the object

**Managing Photos**:
- **Set Main Photo**: Click ⭐ to set a photo as the main display image
- **Edit Photo**: Click ✏️ to update photo metadata
- **Delete Photo**: Click 🗑️ to remove a photo
- The first photo added is automatically set as the main photo
- If no photo exists, a default placeholder image is shown

#### Object Details

Each object shows:
- Main photo (or default placeholder)
- Object type and classification
- Source catalogue
- Constellation
- Coordinates (RA/Dec)
- Magnitude and size (if available)
- Personal notes
- Gallery of all photos

## 📖 Various

### 1. View System Logs

Navigate to **Configuration → Logs** tab to:
- View real-time system logs
- Filter by log level (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Monitor uptonight executions
- Debug issues

### 2. Automated Uptonight Execution

The system automatically:
1. Runs every **2 hours** (configurable via SCHEDULE_INTERVAL environment variable)
2. Uses **defined uptonight version** (set via UPTONIGHT_VERSION)
3. For each selected catalogue:
   - Generates an unique uptonight configuration
   - Launches uptonight Docker container
   - Waits complete processing before processing next catalogue
4. Stores outputs in organized directories
